# Gen_adv
A repo to contain my generative adversarial runner

This repo contains two additional repos: GRU and helix_runner.

GRU is a gate recurrent unit, adapted from a tutorial on GRUs. 
More information can be found in the GRU readme.

helix_runner is a two-layer discriminative neural network to 
distinguish between protein helices and random sequences.

The two are paired to create a generative adversarial network (in progress)
